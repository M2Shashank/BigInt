# BigInt: Big Integers in C++

## Overview

This project implements a custom data type, `BigInt`, in C++ to handle large integers that exceed the limits of standard data types. The `BigInt` class supports essential arithmetic operations and leverages Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to ensure efficient memory usage and maintainable architecture.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, and Modulo.
- **Comparison Operations**: Equal, Not Equal, Greater Than, Less Than, Greater Than or Equal To, Less Than or Equal To.
- **Advanced Operations**: Square Root calculation.
- **Efficient Memory Usage**: Utilizes OOP principles to manage memory efficiently.
- **Robust Design**: Designed for ease of maintenance and extensibility.
